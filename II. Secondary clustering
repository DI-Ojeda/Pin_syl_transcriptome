 Orthology Guided Assembly (OGA) approach
 
 1. Concatenate all transcripts (contigs) obtained individually from strategy A.
 CLCBio tends to produce less transcripts than Trinity, thus for this particularly study we employed the contigs generated with CLCBio
 
 2. A set of proteomes from the same species or a closely related species.
 This set of preoteome will be used to identify transcripts present in the assemblies with homology on the data set reference used.

 SuperTranscripts and CD-HIT clustering
 
 1. Once you obtained the assembly from the primary strategies (B, not guided or C, guided), redundancy is decreased 
 by first clustering the transcripts into SuperTranscripts (representation of all isoforms by a single non-redundant contig)
 using the Lace software version 1.00. 
 
 ##Note
 - Excluded short (≤ 300 bp) and low expressed (total effective count ≤ 10 read count) isoforms prior to running Lace to avoid the inclusion
 of spurios isoforms.
 - Identify SuperTranscripts that appeared to contain similar exonic sequences merged consecutively, as these kinds of “mosaics” could 
 arise due to allelic variation and paralog sequence collapse (PSC). First, identify by self-blasting the SuperTranscripts. 
 All SuperTranscripts that had blast hits within itself (other than the obvious 100% self-match) are potential mosaics, and should be excluded

 2. CD-HIT clustering with sequence identity cut-off (-c) 0.95
