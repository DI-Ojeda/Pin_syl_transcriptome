Assesment of paralog sequence collapse (PSC) in the assembled transcriptomes

Once you have obtained an assembled transcriptome, these are the steps you can follow to determine redundancy due to PSC.
1. Based on genotype, you need first to concatenate all reads from your diploid tissues and haplodid tissues. Then, you mapped the 
different ploidy levels to your reference assembly with STAR aligner, like so:

STAR aligner
a. Index your assembly

b. map the reads

star aligner --read 1 --read2 --runThread 12 --twopassMode Basic --outFilterMultimapNMax 1 outFilterMistmatchNoverLmax 0.025

2. Remove duplicates with SAMtools and assign read groups with the picard tool AddOrReplaceReadGroups. 

3. Call monomorphic and polimorphic sites for each tissue ploidy level mapped with freebayes, like so:

freebayes -regions regions.txt -f Assemly.fasta -u -T 0.005 -= -X --report-monomorphic --genotype-qualities 
-p 2 -L List_embryo_bam_files > output_vcf

##Note, if you have a large transcriptome assembly, you can first generate a regions.txt file of your assembly, and then run freebayes taking into
consideration these regions (- regions option).

4. Filter your vcf files with vcftools

Minimum depth per sample set to 10, and maximum amount of missing data 0.5 per site. For polymorphic sites keep only bi-allelic SNP sites
with a quality > 20. 

5. Estimate number of heterozygous and homozygous variant calls

a. Determine number of heterozygous and homozygous with vcftools using the --hardy option. 
When comparing different assemblies determine per bp level nucleotide diversity per transcript within each assembly. 

b. Estimate observed and expected heterozygosity (Ï€) per nucleotide for each transcript individually. 
Heterozygous calls from reads originating from haploid material is indicate of paralog mapping or sequencing/genotype 
calling errors. Using these levels when comparing different assemblies, you can estimate the level of PSC among 
your reference transcriptomes
