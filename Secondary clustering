 Orthology Guided Assembly (OGA) approach
 
 1. Concatenated all transcripts (contigs) obtained individually from strategy A.
 CLCBio tends to produce less transcripts than Trinity, thus for this particularly study we employed the contigs generated with CLCBio
 
 2. A set of proteomes from the same species or a closely related species.
 This set of preoteome will be used to identify transcripts present in the assemblies with homology on the data set reference used.
